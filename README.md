# Build_It_Bigger
*Project 4 of Ucadity Android Developer Nanodegree*

-----------------------------------

(finished on Sept. 29th, 2015)

Create an app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Google Could Endpoints. The finished app will consist
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Could Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

### Key Components

* Added free and paid flavors to an app, and set up my build to share code between them
* Factored reusable functionalities into Java/android libraries
* Configured a multi project build to compile my libraries and app
* Used the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configured an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
